# Quick outline for the whole paper

1. Introduction
2. Results
    * Using four species, show that transcript reconstruction varies greatly according to the assembler
    * In all four species, an **integrative** method would be capable of extracting the most out of the data
    * results hold also on simulated data
    * Mikado: a method to integrate multiple genome-guided RNA assemblies
        * Division in steps
        * the main algorithm
        * flexibility of the system
    * Mikado and simulated data:
        * show we reach "best of" scenario
        * compare with EvidentialGene, CuffMerge, StringtieMerge, TACO
        * show results with Mikado are idependent of species, can be adapted flexibly (compared to the more rigid competitor systems)
    * Mikado and real data
        * show we improve upon single assemblies
        * show how combining everything together gives best result (one species only, maybe)
        * show
